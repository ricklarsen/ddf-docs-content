Resources are the data that is represented by the cataloged metadata in {branding}.

Metacards are used to describe those resources through metadata. 
This metadata includes the time the resource was created, the location where the resource was created, etc. 
A {branding} `Metacard` contains the `getResourceUri` method, which is used to locate and retrieve its corresponding resource.
