= External/WS-S STS Support

This configuration works just like the STS Client Config for the internal STS, but produces standard requests instead of the custom {branding} ones.
It supports two new auth types for the context policy manager `WSSBASIC` and `WSSPKI`.
Use these auth types when connecting to a non-{branding} STS or if ignoring realms.

== Security STS Address Provider

This selects which STS address are used (for example, in SOAP sources) for clients of this service.
Default is off (internal).
