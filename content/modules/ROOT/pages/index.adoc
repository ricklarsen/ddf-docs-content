.What is DDF?
****
DDF is a free and open-source common data layer that abstracts services and business logic from the underlying data structures to enable rapid integration of new data sources.

DDF is an interoperability platform that provides secure and scalable discovery and retrieval from a wide array of disparate sources. DDF is built to "unzip and run" while having the ability to scale to large enterprise systems.

DDF can be used in accordance with terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Copyright is managed by the Codice Foundation, a non-profit established to provide infrastructure, support, education, and export control advice to government-focused teams desiring to operate open-source projects.
