= Catalog Filter Policy Plugins

Several Policy Plugins for catalog filtering exist currently: xref:architectures:metacard-attribute-plugin.adoc[Metacard Attribute Security Policy Plugin] and xref:architectures:xml-attribute-plugin.adoc[XML Attribute Security Policy Plugin].
These Policy Plugin implementations allow an administrator to easily add filtering capabilities to some standard Metacard types for all {ddf-catalog} operations.
These plugins will place policy information on the Metacard itself that allows the xref:architectures:filter-plugin.adoc[Filter Plugin] to restrict unauthorized users from viewing content they are not allowed to view.
