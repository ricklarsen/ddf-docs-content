= Configuring FTP Endpoint

The FTP endpoint provides a method for ingesting files directly into the {branding} Catalog using the FTP protocol
The files sent over FTP are not first written to the file system, as the xref:managing:configuring/content-directory-monitor.adoc[Directory Monitor] does, but instead the FTP stream of the file is ingested directly into the {branding} catalog, thus avoiding extra I/O overhead.

To install the FTP endpoint:

. Navigate to the *{admin-console}*.
. Select *System*.
. Select *Features*.
. Install the `catalog-ftp` feature.

To configure the FTP endpoint:

. Navigate to the *{admin-console}*.
. Select *System*.
. Select *Features*.
. Select *FTP Endpoint*.

See xref:reference:tables/FtpServerStarter.adoc[FTP Endpoint configurations] for all possible configurations.
