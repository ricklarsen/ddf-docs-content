= Attributes Added by Attribute Overrides (Query)

xref:managing:datamanagement/overriding-attributes.adoc[Attribute Overriding] is the act of replacing existing attribute values with a new value.

Attribute overrides can be configured for query results from the following xref:managing:configuring/connecting-to-sources.adoc[Sources]:

* xref:managing:configuring/sources/confluence-federated-source.adoc[Federated Source For Atlassian Confluence (R)].
* xref:managing:configuring/sources/csw-federated-source.adoc[CSW Specification Profile Federated Source].
* xref:managing:configuring/sources/gmd-csw-source.adoc[GMD CSW Federated Source].

Note that the attribute must be part of the metacard's xref:developing:devcomponents/metacard-type.adoc[Metacard Type] before it can be overridden. +
See xref:managing:datamanagement/attributes-added-by-attribute-injection.adoc[Attributes Added By Attribute Injection] for more information about injecting attributes into the metacard type.
