= Attributes Added by Default Attribute Types

xref:architectures:/metacard-groomer.adoc[Developing Default Attribute Types] is a configurable way to assign default values to a metacard's attributes.

Note that the attribute must be part of the metacard's xref:developing:devcomponents/metacard-type.adoc[Metacard Type] before it can be assigned a default value. +
See xref:managing:datamanagement/attributes-added-by-attribute-injection.adoc[Attributes Added By Attribute Injection] for more information about injecting attributes into the metacard type.
