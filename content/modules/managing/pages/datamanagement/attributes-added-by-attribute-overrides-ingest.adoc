xref:managing:datamanagement/overriding-attributes.adoc[Attribute Overriding] is the act of replacing existing attribute values with a new value.

Attribute overrides can be configured for the xref:managing:configuring/content-directory-monitor.adoc[Content Directory Monitor].

See xref:managing:datamanagement/attributes-added-by-attribute-injection.adoc[Attributes Added By Attribute Injection] for more information about injecting attributes into the metacard type.
