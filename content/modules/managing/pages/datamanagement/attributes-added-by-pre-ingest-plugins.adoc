= Attributes Added by Pre-Ingest Plugins

The xref:architectures:pre-ingest-intro.adoc[Pre-Ingest Plugins] are responsible for setting attribute fields on metacards before they are stored in the catalog.

* The xref:architectures:expiration-date-plugin.adoc[Expiration Date Pre-Ingest Plugin] adds or updates expiration dates which can be used later for archiving old data.
* The xref:architectures:geocoder-plugin.adoc[Geocoder Plugin] is responsible for populating the metacard’s `Location.COUNTRY_CODE` attribute if the metacard has an associated location. If the metacard’s country code is already populated, the plugin will not override it.
* The xref:architectures:metacard-groomer.adoc[Metacard Groomer] plugin adds/updates IDs and timestamps to the created metacard.
