= Introduction to the Catalog Framework

The Catalog Framework wires all the Catalog components together.

It is responsible for routing Catalog requests and responses to the appropriate source, destination, federated system, etc. 

xref:coreconcepts/endpoints-intro.adoc[Endpoints] send Catalog requests to the Catalog Framework.
The Catalog Framework then invokes Catalog Plugins, Transformers, and Resource Components as needed before sending requests to the intended destination, such as one or more Sources. 

The Catalog Framework decouples clients from service implementations and provides integration points for Catalog Plugins and convenience methods for Endpoint developers.
